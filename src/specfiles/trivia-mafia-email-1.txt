Now, back to knowing it all! This week we're checking in with Greg's Grog Blog, a long-running Friday-Know-It-All repeat* column that's all about grog and grogprods (grog products).

As you might guess, we here at Trivia Mafia have a rich appreciation for rich libations. Our hosts get to enjoy all sorts of delicious drinks and snacks at our partner bars and restaurants as they work (did you know we're hiring (https://www.triviamafia.com/jobs) ?) but one I don't think has ever crossed my lips is the noble drink of grog.

Grog gets its name from Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon of the British Navy, who instituted the practice of using grog as part of the payment for sailors. What's that, you say? No part of that man's name is grog or like grog? Correct, I say! His nickname was Old Grogram (https://www.etymonline.com/word/grog#etymonline_v_14294) , or Old Grog, for the grogram coat he wore, a term borrowed from the French for any coarse, woven fabric. (No relation to the Old Gregg of "The Mighty Boosh," which basically spoiled the existence of Greg and Gregg alike for years.)

Grog was created as a solution to two issues (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog#Popularization_of_rum_and_invention_of_grog)  at sea. First off, fresh water would develop algae and slime on long voyages, and while they'd initially mix it with fermented drinks, beer and wine didn't keep much better. The second issue concerned drunkenness. Sailors were to be issued a half pint of rum every day as part of their compensation, but some would sock it away and go on nautical benders, leading many captains to famously ask "what SHALL we do with a drunken sailor? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_Sailor) "

So the practice of serving sailors grog came to pass as a means of counteracting slimy water and drunkenness, doled out twice throughout the day. The dilution kept the sailors (reasonably) sober, and as the water spoiled, it kept sailors from hoarding their daily rum rations. It wasn't until 1795 that lemon juice and sugar officially made their way into the mix as an abatement to scurvy on long voyages. The lemons were replaced with limes as relations with France soured, dubbing British sailors with the title of "limeys."

A brief side note, the British discovered the importance of citrus in grog through one of history's first randomized controlled trials (https://theconversation.com/how-the-british-defeated-napoleon-with-citrus-fruit-58826) thanks to the work of Scottish Royal Navy surgeon James Lind. Of a dozen scurvy-ridden sailors, five were given seawater for treatment, five were given cider, and two were given two oranges and a lemon daily. Those last two recovered so swiftly that one of them was given the task of helping the remaining ten patients recover. Probably a big task, given half of those scurvy seadogs were stuck drinking saltwater. This development was key to Britain's naval dominance, and helped them maintain the blockade that broke Napoleon's global aspirations.

As with many nautical matters, there's a handy rhyme (https://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/caribbean/grog/) if you find yourself wanting to make grog at home: one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak. That would be lemon juice (or lime, depending on your feelings on Napoleon), simple syrup or molasses, rum, and water. Still or sparkling, as you prefer! You can even try it hot (https://cookthink.com/traditional-hot-grog/) !

And that's all there is to know this week! Thanks for reading. -- Private Events Specialist Greg
